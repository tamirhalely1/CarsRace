# Autonomous Racing: Completing Laps with LiDAR

---

## Overview

The primary objective of this project is to develop a sophisticated autonomous racing system that enables a car to complete laps around a race track with precision and efficiency. We achieve this by integrating a LiDAR sensor system with advanced neural network algorithms to enable real-time decision-making and navigation.
 
## Features
* LiDAR Sensor Integration: Our system utilizes LiDAR sensors to provide accurate and detailed environmental data, allowing the vehicle to perceive the track layout, obstacles, and other vehicles.
* Neural Network Decision Making: A neural network architecture processes LiDAR data to make instantaneous decisions regarding vehicle speed, steering, and maneuvering, ensuring the vehicle follows the optimal racing line and avoids collisions.
* Real-time Performance Evaluation: Our system provides real-time monitoring of lap times, vehicle position, and other performance metrics, allowing users to assess the effectiveness of the autonomous racing algorithms and make necessary adjustments for optimization.
